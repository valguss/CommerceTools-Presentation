## World Of Books
- Used to be on Magento 1.7
- Upgraded to Magento 1.9
- Moved to Commerce Tools

---
## Why the move?
- 1M+ products
- Indexers were not coping with the updates (hours instead of minutes)
- Multi channel. They were using Magmi CSV import/Export
- Need stock updates similar to C+B
---
## What have they gained
- Apparently went from 1% to 12% revenue through website
  - I forgot to ask what thye put this jump down to
- All channels have up to date stock info
- They now don't see a finite end of using CommerceTools
  - They considered M2 but saw a EOL for it
---
## Other advantages
- They have an inhouse dev team that make the frontend updates
- They connect to different API's for best in class experience.
  - Not bound by what magento etc allow
  - Add in Contentful content where ever they want it
---
## Anything else?
- They showed us some of their frontend testing suite for Laura Ashley
- They reckon they took 18months of Selenium work from previous developers, and rewrote it in 6 weeks by 2.5/3 resources to Cucumber/Gherkin
- What that? Natural language testing. Similar to how we now write our DD's
